## About

This repository serves as a collection of lab programs for practicing data structures and algorithms concepts. Whether you're a student learning about DSA or an enthusiast honing your skills, you'll find a variety of programs to explore and experiment with.

## Contents

The programs are organized into different directories based on the data structures or algorithms they cover. Here's a brief overview of what you'll find:

- **Arrays**: Programs related to array manipulation, searching, and sorting.
- **Linked Lists**: Implementations of singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists along with relevant operations.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Examples of stack and queue implementations using arrays and linked lists.
- **Trees**: Binary tree, binary search tree, AVL tree, heap, and other tree-related implementations.
- **Graphs**: Graph representation and algorithms like breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS).
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Algorithms like linear search, binary search, and their variations.
- **Hashing**: Implementations of hashing techniques including open addressing and chaining.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Dynamic programming solutions to classic problems like the knapsack problem, longest common subsequence, etc.

Feel free to explore each directory to find programs of interest.
